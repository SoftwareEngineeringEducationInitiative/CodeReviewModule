# Best Practices for Code Review

- Identify defects, don't attempt to solve them (some advice may be ok, but discuss in detail offline)
- Ask leading questions if the code 'smells' funny ("why did you do it this way?" or "I'm trying to understand this code, walk me through the options you considered" rather than, "why didn't you do it the way I would have?" )
- Ask others (not the author) if they think the code is ok, ask them why they think it is good.
- Ask if this is the best solution, then discuss some options the author can consider for achieving a better solution. The goal of this expensive activity is to ensure the team is creating the best code.
- Think about others who will have to extend the code long after the author is gone. Is the code documented well enough for someone to easily understand it.
- Don't make it personal. Speak to others about their code the way you would like others to speak to you about yours. You must provide constructive criticism.
- Whether you are the author or not, this is a learning experience. Pay attention to what other people are saying. Ask questions!
