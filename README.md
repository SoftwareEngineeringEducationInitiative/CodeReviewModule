# Overview
*Peer review* (or *code review*) is a technique where developers ask their peers to identify defects in their code before releasing it. There are different types of reviews ranging from very formal and heavyweight to less formal and lightweight. More formal reviews are a source of data that can be used to measure the effectiveness of a software organization.

Peer review relies on human judgement and experience to identify defects in code. It is a manual form of static analysis. In most variations of peer review, defects are identified and reported back to the author of the code. The peer review is not intended to be a venue for fixing defects. The author is expected to fix the work product based on the feedback from review.

Formal peer reviews, like Fagan Inspections, are considered somewhat expensive due to the coordination required and the number of face-to-face person-hours required to perform them. However, they are very effective with an average defect removal rate of 65% [Capers Jones]. 

There is an added educational benefit to these formal reviews. Less experienced developers get to hear how more experienced developers think about code and they are able to participate in discussions with them about it. 

Less formal reviews, sometimes called desk reviews, are ones where one or two peer developers read the code independently and then provide feedback to the author. These are typically less expensive but may also be less effective. 

The Agile development practice of pair programming is intended to be a ‘preemptive code review’. If having peers review the code after it is written is considered a good practice, the thinking goes, then why not have a peer next to the author as they are writing it?  

# Level
- Introductory

# Student Learning Outcomes
- After reading a peer's code, the student will be able to discover faults in it and communicate those faults to the team.
- Students will be able to communicate the faults in a way that is clear and concise. They will do so in a way that shows sensitivity and compassion.
- Students will be able to revise their code based on feedback from a review.


# Why Learn About Peer Review?
- The software produced by a team performing code reviews is of a markedly higher quality.
- Members of a team performing code reviews will become acquainted with more of the system. - The knowledge of each others work will grow as a result of being exposed to code written by other members of the team.
- Developers are often asked to write more code than they read. Being exposed to other people's code offers a valuable learning experience. 
- Developers learn how to critique a colleague's work.
- Developers learn how to take constructive criticism.
