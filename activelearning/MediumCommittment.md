# Overview 

A more authentic exercise is to perform a code review of the instructor's code. In this activity the instructor will either write some code or find some code from an anonymous source. The instructor will then inject some defects into the code for the students to find.

In class, the instructor will review the roles of members and the phases in the review process. Next, the instructor will make the code available and schedule the inspection for the a future class period. The class is expected to do the preparation work outside of class before the inspection. 

During the inspection the instructor will act as the author, moderator, reader, and recorder. The students are only asked to be reviewers. The instructor will read the code aloud and the students will interrupt them to identify their defects. The instructor will lead a discussion about each proposed defect. Students should feel safe critiquing the code if it is the instructors or from an anonymous source. If the students aren't contributing much at first the instructor can identify some of the defects that they injected. It is likely that the students will find more defects than were injected. Be sure to tell the students when they find authentic defects!

No follow up work will happen. It may take one or two class periods to complete the inspection part of the review.
