# Overview 

The most authentic activity to perform in class is to have the students review each other's work. This requires the instructor to break the class into groups of three to six. Then the instructor must come up with a set of requirements that can be shared among the members of the group. One approach is to assign a function to each member of the group. Each group can work on the same problem. 

Each member will have a certain number of future class periods to write their code. On an agreed upon date, all the team members will share their completed code. The students will then prepare for the inspections on a future date. Then the students will take turns inspecting their code in class. The students will take turns in the roles mentioned above. 

After each inspection, the author will get the review log with the defects and be expected to revise the work. The student will submit a copy of the original code, the review log, and the revised code to the instructor for grading.  

It is worth mentioning that this can be very stressful activity for students. They likely have never had their code looked at and commented on by their peers. It is important to put students at ease and clearly define what is acceptable and what is not in a professional code review. These are some guidelines I give to the class:
