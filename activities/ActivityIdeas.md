1. Bring in a guest speaker with industry experience to talk about how they do peer review in their organization. Solicit guest speakers from your contacts, colleagues, and former students. Try to bring in at least two different people hopefully with different roles (low level engineer, high level manager, Q&A, etc). This is a great opportunity for students to talk to real software developers.

2. Find alreeady closed pull requests where there is a good code review and use as oracles. Create a sandbox presenting the snapshot of the project and recreate the pull requests you wish to use. Ask students to review. After reviewing, point them to the actual pull request so they can compare their outcomes
